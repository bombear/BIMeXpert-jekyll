      <h1 class="article_header">Quick overview of BIM</h1>
      <p class="article_normal">
Although the term “BIM” is widely known in the construction and civil engineering industry, it is safe to say that the concepts regarding the definition and the use of BIM technology vary a lot. Being a relatively new technology and bringing fundamental changes to workflow and project structure, the correct definition must be found and used globally.
The acronym BIM comes from Building Information Modeling or Building Information Management, each name representing and emphasizing different aspects of the technology. The second term might be more accurate considering the holistic approach required to the full exploitation of the advantages of BIM.

      <p class="definition">
          <span id="definitionTitle">Short definition:</span>
          BIM is the complete database of 3D models and <span class="bold">all</span> supplementary <span class="bold">information</span>  regarding the facility in focus, where participants of a BIM project have access and modification rights <span class="bold">simultaneously</span>  to specific data groups of the central database based on their particular roles spanning throughout the <span class="bold">lifecycle</span>  of the facility or project.
      </p>
      <p class="article_normal">
The transition to BIM use demands fundamental changes in the design process and ensures much smoother collaboration and data handling. Information exchange and management gets much easier due to the use of a well-coordinated central database instead of hundreds of DWG, PDF and text files sent by e-mail, and stored in endless and ever changing folder structures without effective version handling.

      </p>
      <p class="article_normal">
During the <span class="bold">design phase </span> collaborating groups have the possibility to follow the progress of related specializations and groups, and automatically find and evaluate <span class="bold">conflicting solutions</span>  and <span class="bold">geometrical collisions</span>. Coupled with an effective project coordination these possibilities allow for coherent and extremely final plans that require no additional design and recurrent corrections for fixing collisions or practical feasibility issues in the construction phase.
</p>
      <p class="article_normal">
         A complete building information model allows for model based <span class="bold">scheduling</span> (4D BIM), model based <span class="bold">Bill of Material</span> lists (5D BIM). These features coupled with the <span class="bold">effectivity in construction</span>  thanks to the high quality and clash-free plans help lower investment costs by a large margin. </br>
The <span class="bold">operation </span> of facilities with BIM database can also be much more cost effective compared to facilities with traditional project databases due to the instantly available and accurate information about all systems, parts, suppliers and operating parameters.        </p>
      <p class="article_normal">
The advantages of BIM can only be exploited using a sufficiently coherent and information-rich database. In most cases the database has to be built during the <span class="bold">design phase </span> of the building / construction. This need pushes and urges designer (architect, MEP) companies to gain knowledge to shift to BIM compliant model creation and workflow in order to be able to deliver plans that meet the essential, well-defined requirements set by the builder and the general coordinator of the project.        </p>
