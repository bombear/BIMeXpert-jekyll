            <p class="sectionText">
                Though the real advantage of BIM is realized in the investor/developer segment, this advantage inevitably creates the demand for designer companies to comply with the requirements of BIM. Even today only BIM compliant companies have access to a large and rapidly growing segment of the industry. The extra effort laid into the design phase opens up new markets and helps developing an approach that is modern and compatible with the quickly changing industrial environment.

                Overload, ruined partner and sub-contractor relationships and low profit. Without the expertise and suitable approach of BIM projects companies and entire projects face real difficulties and drawbacks. Designers need to have a deep knowledge even at the contract phase of the project. The contract has to be in accordance with particular BIM related routines and issues, and with collaboration methods among collaborating specializations in order to result in mutually beneficial output for all stakeholders: Investing, Design, Construction and Operation. Our experiences show that the knowledge and expertise of the design segment can help Investors to set realistic and feasible terms for the entire project, and to move away from “the cheapest is the best” approach.
